### Hello there!

I'm Cloud Solution Architect (CSA) at Microsoft focusing on Azure application development. You can also find me in [Twitter](https://twitter.com/janne_mattila) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jannemattila/).

Occasionally (read: too rarely), I blog about different development topics in these places:

* Primary: [dev.to/janne_mattila](https://dev.to/janne_mattila/)
* Secondary: [medium.com/@janne_mattila](https://medium.com/@janne_mattila)
* Old archive: [docs.microsoft.com/archive/blogs/jannemattila](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/blogs/jannemattila/)

> From programmer to programmer -- Programming just for the fun of it
